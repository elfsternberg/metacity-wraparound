This is a small patch to Metacity, the window manager for the Gnome
2.0 desktop.  This patch enables keyboard navigation of the
multi-desktop to "wrap around" from the last desktop to the first, or
vice versa.

This feature is available on the Motif multi-desktop window manager,
so it's been around since 1997 or so.  Why modern desktops don't
support this is beyond me, but as a developer with a fondness for
keyboard solutions, it's a must-have.
