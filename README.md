This is a small patch to Metacity, the window manager for the Gnome
2.0 desktop.  This patch enables keyboard navigation of the
multi-desktop to "wrap around" from the last desktop to the first, or
vice versa.

This feature can now be enabled automatically in the modern Mate' 
desktops, so this code is no longer needed.
